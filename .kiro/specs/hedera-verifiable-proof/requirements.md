# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Verifiable Proof system on Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) with an Autonomous AI Agent for carbon credit verification. The system will create tamper-proof, publicly auditable "digital birth certificates" for energy data and automate the MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) process for carbon credit issuance.

## Glossary

- **Hedera_Consensus_Service**: Hedera's distributed ledger service for consensus timestamping and ordering
- **Digital_Birth_Certificate**: Cryptographically signed proof of energy data anchored to HCS
- **MRV_Process**: Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification workflow for carbon credits
- **AI_Agent**: Autonomous system that processes energy data and generates verification reports
- **Energy_Batch**: Collection of energy readings from ESP32 devices aggregated for verification
- **Proof_Anchor**: Cryptographic hash of batched data submitted to Hedera network
- **Guardian_Service**: External carbon credit management platform
- **ESP32_Device**: IoT energy monitoring hardware sending real-time data
- **Carbon_Credit**: Verified unit representing one metric ton of CO2 equivalent

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a carbon credit project developer, I want energy data to be cryptographically verified and anchored to Hedera, so that I have tamper-proof evidence for carbon credit claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Energy_Batch contains at least 100 energy readings, THE Hedera_Service SHALL create a cryptographic hash of the batch data
2. WHEN cryptographic hash is generated, THE Hedera_Service SHALL submit the hash to Hedera_Consensus_Service as a Proof_Anchor
3. WHEN Proof_Anchor is submitted, THE Hedera_Service SHALL receive a consensus timestamp from HCS
4. WHEN consensus timestamp is received, THE Hedera_Service SHALL store the Digital_Birth_Certificate with timestamp and transaction ID
5. THE Hedera_Service SHALL ensure all energy data is immutably linked to its corresponding Proof_Anchor

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a carbon credit verifier, I want to access publicly auditable proof of energy generation, so that I can independently verify carbon credit claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Digital_Birth_Certificate is created, THE Hedera_Service SHALL make the proof publicly queryable via transaction ID
2. THE Hedera_Service SHALL provide API endpoints to retrieve proof data using device ID and date range
3. WHEN proof is queried, THE Hedera_Service SHALL return the original data hash, HCS timestamp, and verification status
4. THE Hedera_Service SHALL allow third-party verification of data integrity using the stored hash
5. WHERE public audit is requested, THE Hedera_Service SHALL provide complete audit trail from ESP32_Device to Proof_Anchor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project operator, I want the AI agent to automatically verify energy data and prepare Guardian-compatible reports, so that I can streamline the carbon credit issuance process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Energy_Batch is anchored to Hedera, THE AI_Agent SHALL automatically analyze the data for anomalies and inconsistencies
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL calculate carbon credit equivalents based on verified energy generation data using AMS-I.D methodology
3. WHEN analysis is complete, THE AI_Agent SHALL generate Guardian-compatible Verifiable Credential reports matching the AMS-I.D format
4. THE AI_Agent SHALL create DID (Decentralized Identifier) through Guardian_Service API for project participant identity
5. WHERE Guardian_Service integration is available, THE AI_Agent SHALL automatically submit verified reports as Verifiable Credentials for carbon credit issuance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the batching process to be efficient and cost-effective, so that we can handle high-volume energy data without excessive Hedera transaction costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hedera_Service SHALL batch energy readings into optimal groups to minimize HCS transaction costs
2. WHEN batch size reaches 1000 readings OR 1 hour time limit, THE Hedera_Service SHALL trigger the anchoring process
3. THE Hedera_Service SHALL compress batch data before hashing to optimize storage and transmission
4. THE Hedera_Service SHALL implement retry logic for failed HCS submissions with exponential backoff
5. THE Hedera_Service SHALL maintain local backup of all batched data before HCS submission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and Guardian-compatible reporting capabilities, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance for carbon credit projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Agent SHALL generate Guardian-compatible Verifiable Credential reports following AMS-I.D structure with participant_profile, tool_07 calculations, and emission reductions
2. WHEN audit report is requested, THE AI_Agent SHALL include device metadata, Hedera proof anchors, data quality metrics, and consensus timestamps
3. THE AI_Agent SHALL calculate and report data completeness, accuracy, and reliability scores based on ESP32_Device readings
4. WHERE data gaps or anomalies exist, THE AI_Agent SHALL document exceptions in Guardian-compatible format with Hedera proof references
5. THE AI_Agent SHALL maintain historical reporting data linked to Hedera transaction IDs for multi-year compliance tracking

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project developer, I want real-time monitoring of the verification system, so that I can ensure continuous operation and quickly address any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hedera_Service SHALL provide real-time status monitoring for HCS connectivity and transaction success rates
2. WHEN HCS submission fails, THE Hedera_Service SHALL send immediate alerts to system administrators
3. THE AI_Agent SHALL monitor data quality metrics and alert when thresholds are exceeded
4. THE Hedera_Service SHALL track and report system performance metrics including batch processing times
5. WHERE system issues are detected, THE Hedera_Service SHALL automatically attempt recovery procedures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an ESP32 device operator, I want seamless integration with the verification system, so that my energy data is automatically included in the tamper-proof record.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESP32_Device sends energy data to the backend, THE Hedera_Service SHALL automatically include it in the next batch
2. THE Hedera_Service SHALL validate ESP32 data format and reject malformed submissions
3. WHEN data is batched, THE Hedera_Service SHALL maintain traceability from individual ESP32_Device to final Proof_Anchor
4. THE Hedera_Service SHALL support multiple ESP32_Device connections simultaneously
5. WHERE device authentication is required, THE Hedera_Service SHALL verify device credentials before accepting data
### R
equirement 8

**User Story:** As a project participant, I want the system to automatically create my DID and submit Guardian-compatible reports, so that I can participate in carbon credit programs without manual intervention.
