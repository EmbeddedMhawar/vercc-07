# Backend Organization Requirements

## Introduction

The current backend system is a monolithic FastAPI application with all functionality concentrated in a single main.py file (808 lines) and supporting service files. The system handles ESP32 energy data collection, real-time WebSocket communication, Supabase database integration, Guardian Service integration, Hedera blockchain proof anchoring, and serves an embedded HTML dashboard. This architecture needs to be reorganized into a modular, maintainable, and scalable structure following modern Python backend best practices.

## Glossary

- **Backend_System**: The FastAPI-based server application that processes energy data and provides APIs
- **Service_Layer**: Abstracted business logic components that handle specific domain operations
- **API_Layer**: FastAPI route handlers and endpoint definitions
- **Data_Layer**: Database models, repositories, and data access patterns
- **Configuration_System**: Environment variable management and application settings
- **Middleware_System**: Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and CORS
- **Static_Content**: Frontend assets and dashboard HTML content management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized backend codebase, so that I can easily maintain, extend, and debug the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_System SHALL organize code into logical modules with clear separation of concerns
2. THE Backend_System SHALL separate API routes from business logic implementation
3. THE Backend_System SHALL isolate database operations into dedicated repository classes
4. THE Backend_System SHALL extract service classes for Guardian, Hedera, and energy processing operations
5. THE Backend_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management, so that I can easily deploy the application across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_System SHALL centralize all environment variable handling
2. THE Configuration_System SHALL provide type-safe configuration objects
3. THE Configuration_System SHALL validate required configuration values at startup
4. THE Configuration_System SHALL support development, testing, and production configurations
5. THE Configuration_System SHALL separate database, external service, and application configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular service architecture, so that I can test and modify individual components independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Service_Layer SHALL implement dependency injection for service components
2. THE Service_Layer SHALL provide abstract interfaces for external service integrations
3. THE Service_Layer SHALL separate Guardian Service operations into dedicated service classes
4. THE Service_Layer SHALL separate Hedera blockchain operations into dedicated service classes
5. THE Service_Layer SHALL implement proper error handling and logging for each service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean API structure, so that I can easily add new endpoints and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Layer SHALL organize routes into logical router modules by domain
2. THE API_Layer SHALL separate energy data endpoints from participant management endpoints
3. THE API_Layer SHALL separate testing endpoints from production endpoints
4. THE API_Layer SHALL implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
5. THE API_Layer SHALL provide proper request/response validation using Pydantic models

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data access patterns, so that I can efficiently manage database operations and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data_Layer SHALL implement repository pattern for database operations
2. THE Data_Layer SHALL separate database models from API response models
3. THE Data_Layer SHALL provide transaction management for complex operations
4. THE Data_Layer SHALL implement proper connection pooling and error handling
5. THE Data_Layer SHALL support both Supabase and potential future database migrations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper middleware and cross-cutting concerns, so that I can handle authentication, logging, and monitoring consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Middleware_System SHALL implement structured logging with proper log levels
2. THE Middleware_System SHALL provide request/response logging middleware
3. THE Middleware_System SHALL implement proper CORS handling for frontend integration
4. THE Middleware_System SHALL support authentication middleware for protected endpoints
5. THE Middleware_System SHALL provide health check and monitoring endpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper static content management, so that I can serve frontend assets efficiently and migrate to SolidJS frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Static_Content SHALL separate embedded HTML dashboard from main application code
2. THE Static_Content SHALL provide configurable static file serving
3. THE Static_Content SHALL support both embedded dashboard and SolidJS frontend serving
4. THE Static_Content SHALL implement proper caching headers for static assets
5. THE Static_Content SHALL allow easy switching between development and production frontend builds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_System SHALL provide test configuration and fixtures
2. THE Backend_System SHALL support unit testing for individual service components
3. THE Backend_System SHALL support integration testing for API endpoints
4. THE Backend_System SHALL provide mock implementations for external services
5. THE Backend_System SHALL maintain test coverage for critical business logic
