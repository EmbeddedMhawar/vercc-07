# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing React frontend application to SolidJS while maintaining all current functionality, user experience, and visual design. The migration should preserve the authentication system, dashboard functionality, landing page, and signin page while leveraging SolidJS's performance benefits and reactive primitives. The goal is to have a functionally equivalent SolidJS application that can replace the React version.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the React frontend to SolidJS, so that I can benefit from SolidJS's performance improvements and simpler reactivity model while maintaining all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the SolidJS application SHALL provide identical functionality to the React version
2. WHEN users interact with the application THEN all user flows SHALL work exactly as they do in the React version
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the visual design and styling SHALL be identical to the React version
4. WHEN authentication is performed THEN the Supabase integration SHALL work seamlessly with SolidJS

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work identically in the SolidJS version, so that I can sign in and access protected routes without any changes to my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signin page THEN they SHALL see the same interface and functionality as the React version
2. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN they SHALL be redirected to the dashboard as in the React version
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected routes THEN they SHALL be redirected to signin as in the React version
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN their session SHALL persist across page refreshes
5. WHEN the AuthContext is used THEN it SHALL provide the same API and behavior as the React version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages (Landing, Signin, Dashboard) to look and function identically in the SolidJS version, so that my user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN they SHALL see identical content, styling, and interactive elements
2. WHEN a user visits the signin page THEN all form elements and validation SHALL work as in the React version
3. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN all components and functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN interactive elements are used THEN animations and transitions SHALL match the React version
5. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the layout SHALL adapt identically across all screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all reusable components to be migrated to SolidJS, so that the component architecture remains modular and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are migrated THEN Button, Card, Icon, InteractiveElement, and InteractiveGradientBackground SHALL maintain their APIs
2. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL render identically to their React counterparts
3. WHEN component props are passed THEN they SHALL be handled with the same type safety as React components
4. WHEN components have internal state THEN they SHALL use SolidJS signals appropriately
5. WHEN components have side effects THEN they SHALL use SolidJS lifecycle methods correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system and development environment to be properly configured for SolidJS, so that development workflow remains efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server is started THEN it SHALL provide hot module replacement and fast refresh
2. WHEN the application is built for production THEN it SHALL generate optimized bundles
3. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN it SHALL provide proper type checking for SolidJS components
4. WHEN CSS and styling are processed THEN Tailwind CSS SHALL work identically to the React version
5. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured for the SolidJS build system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities in the SolidJS version, so that development and maintenance remain straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN SolidJS DevTools SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN console errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear information about the issue
4. WHEN the application fails to load THEN users SHALL see appropriate error messages
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN error states SHALL be handled consistently with the React version
