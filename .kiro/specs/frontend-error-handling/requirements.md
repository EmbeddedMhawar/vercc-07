# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing error handling and success feedback in the frontend-solid application. The system currently has basic error handling but needs comprehensive error management, user-friendly feedback, and consistent success notifications across all user interactions.

## Glossary

- **Frontend_Application**: The SolidJS-based user interface for the VerifiedCC platform
- **Error_Handler**: Centralized system for managing and displaying error messages
- **Success_Feedback**: User interface elements that confirm successful operations
- **Notification_System**: Toast-style notifications for real-time user feedback
- **Form_Validation**: Client-side validation with immediate error feedback
- **API_Error**: Server-side errors returned from backend API calls
- **Network_Error**: Connection failures or timeout errors
- **User_Feedback**: Visual and textual cues that inform users about system state
- **Loading_State**: Visual indicators showing ongoing operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API_Error occurs, THE Frontend_Application SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical error codes
2. WHEN Network_Error occurs, THE Frontend_Application SHALL show connection-specific error messages with retry options
3. WHEN form validation fails, THE Frontend_Application SHALL highlight invalid fields with specific error descriptions
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL categorize errors by severity (info, warning, error, critical)
5. WHERE multiple errors occur simultaneously, THE Frontend_Application SHALL display them in a prioritized list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when I perform actions, so that I know my actions were successful or if I need to try again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits a form successfully, THE Frontend_Application SHALL display a success notification with confirmation details
2. WHEN user performs any action, THE Frontend_Application SHALL show Loading_State indicators during processing
3. WHEN operation completes successfully, THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide Success_Feedback with relevant action details
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL auto-dismiss success notifications after 5 seconds unless user interaction is required
5. WHERE user needs to take follow-up action, THE Frontend_Application SHALL include actionable buttons in success messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent notification behavior across the application, so that I have a predictable user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Application SHALL use a unified Notification_System for all user feedback
2. WHEN notifications appear, THE Frontend_Application SHALL position them consistently in the top-right corner
3. THE Frontend_Application SHALL use consistent styling for different notification types (success, error, warning, info)
4. WHEN multiple notifications are active, THE Frontend_Application SHALL stack them vertically with proper spacing
5. THE Frontend_Application SHALL allow users to manually dismiss notifications with a close button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation that helps me correct mistakes immediately, so that I can complete forms efficiently without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user enters invalid data, THE Frontend_Application SHALL show field-level validation errors in real-time
2. THE Frontend_Application SHALL validate required fields when user leaves the field (onBlur)
3. WHEN validation errors exist, THE Frontend_Application SHALL disable form submission and highlight invalid fields
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL show validation success indicators for correctly filled fields
5. WHERE form has multiple steps, THE Frontend_Application SHALL validate each step before allowing progression

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what's happening during long operations, so that I don't think the application is frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operation takes longer than 1 second, THE Frontend_Application SHALL display Loading_State indicators
2. THE Frontend_Application SHALL show progress indicators for operations with known duration
3. WHEN operation is processing, THE Frontend_Application SHALL disable relevant UI elements to prevent duplicate submissions
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide cancel options for long-running operations where applicable
5. WHERE operation fails after loading, THE Frontend_Application SHALL transition smoothly from loading to error state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want error recovery options when things go wrong, so that I can continue using the application without starting over.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recoverable error occurs, THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide retry buttons with error messages
2. THE Frontend_Application SHALL implement exponential backoff for automatic retry attempts
3. WHEN form submission fails, THE Frontend_Application SHALL preserve user input and allow resubmission
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide "Report Issue" links for unrecoverable errors
5. WHERE session expires, THE Frontend_Application SHALL redirect to login with return-to-page functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want contextual help when errors occur, so that I can understand how to resolve issues myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation error occurs, THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide specific guidance on how to fix the input
2. THE Frontend_Application SHALL include help text for complex form fields before errors occur
3. WHEN API_Error occurs, THE Frontend_Application SHALL suggest possible solutions based on error type
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL provide links to relevant documentation or support for complex errors
5. WHERE error is related to user permissions, THE Frontend_Application SHALL explain required access levels

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my progress when errors occur, so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form submission fails, THE Frontend_Application SHALL retain all user input in form fields
2. THE Frontend_Application SHALL auto-save draft data for long forms every 30 seconds
3. WHEN page refreshes after error, THE Frontend_Application SHALL restore user's previous state where possible
4. THE Frontend_Application SHALL warn users before navigating away from unsaved changes
5. WHERE session is restored, THE Frontend_Application SHALL show notification about recovered data
