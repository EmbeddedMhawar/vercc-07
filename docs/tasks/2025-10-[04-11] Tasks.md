# Tech Tasks

## Rules

- Always prefix tasks with who took them:
  - {M: Mhawar} for Mhawar
  - {A: Aitlamine} for Aitlamine
- When you finish a task, commit to Github for version history and use a conventional commit message
- Follow [Conventional Commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when adding or updating tasks
- If you notice an efficiency improvement, add it as a rule here
- Task status conventions:
  - `- [ ]` = not taken
  - `- [-]` = in progress
  - `- [X]` = done
- You have ability to send any message (comments) in any place with # eg : # {M: Mhawar : we got this! }
- The workflow is [frontend](to visualize the logic)->[backend](to make the logic)->[communication](to express the logic)
- Priority will be at front of task (A): Urgent-Important , (B): Less_urgent-Important, (C): Urgent-Not_Important, (D): Less_urgent-Not_Important
