# Tech Tasks

## Rules
- Always prefix tasks with who took them:  
  - `{M: Mhawar}` for Mhawar  
  - `{A: Aitlamine}` for Aitlamine  
- When you finish a task, commit to Github for version history and use a conventional commit message  
- Follow [Conventional Commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when adding or updating tasks  
- If you notice an efficiency improvement, add it as a rule  
- Task status conventions:  
  - `- [ ]` = not taken  
  - `- [-]` = in progress  
  - `- [X]` = done
