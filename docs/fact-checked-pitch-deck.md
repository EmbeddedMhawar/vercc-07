## Recommended Pitch Deck Corrections

### Slide 3: Solution Description
**Original**: "An AI agent then automates the verification process"
**Corrected**: "Guardian Service integration automates participant onboarding and DID creation, with AI-powered verification capabilities in development"

### Slide 7: Tokenomics
**Original**: "Utility Token (VCCT): A proposed token to bootstrap the network"
**Corrected**: "Tokenomics Strategy: VCCT utility token design completed, implementation planned for post-hackathon development"

### Slide 8: Traction
**Original**: Should emphasize specific technical achievements
**Enhanced**: 
- ‚úÖ Live Hedera testnet deployment with verifiable transactions
- ‚úÖ Guardian Service integration with automated DID creation
- ‚úÖ End-to-end data pipeline from ESP32 to carbon credits
- ‚úÖ Real-time dashboard with WebSocket updates
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive database architecture with audit trails

### Slide 11-12: TRL Assessment
**Confirmed**: TRL 5-6 (Prototype) is accurate
- Working prototype with live Hedera integration
- Guardian Service automation implemented
- End-to-end workflow functional
- Public verification system operational

## Conclusion

The VerifiedCC project demonstrates strong technical execution with a working prototype that successfully integrates:
- Hedera Consensus Service for immutable proof anchoring
- Guardian Service for automated carbon credit workflows
- Real-time IoT data processing and batching
- Public verification system via Mirror Node

The core technical claims are well-supported by implementation, with the main gaps being in advanced AI features and token economics, which are appropriately positioned as future development rather than current capabilities.

**Overall Assessment**: The pitch deck technical claims are largely accurate, with minor adjustments needed for AI automation scope and tokenomics implementation status.
